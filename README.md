# About
This is a simple tool for source code analysis, such as counting the total lines of source code (i.e. .c .cpp) in a specific directory. The small project arises of my interest, and I don't know where it goes.

# Usage
**Examples:** 

python count_lines.py ./src .cpp

python count_lines.py ~/path/dir .h .hpp .c .cpp
