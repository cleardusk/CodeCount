Description: # About
        This is a simple tool for source code analysis, such as counting the total lines of source code (i.e. .c .cpp) in a specific directory. The small project arises of my interest, and I don't know where it goes.
        
        # Usage
        **Examples:** 
        
        ```
        python count_lines.py ./src cpp
        
        python count_lines.py ~/path/dir h hpp c cpp
        
        $ python count_lines.py ~/Projects/caffe/ cpp c hpp h py m sh           
        177601
        ```
        
        **Attention**
        
        The suffix name does not contain dot '.' .
